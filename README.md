# BinarySearch
This repository contains source code in java for an algorithm that search an integer in an array using the binary search algorithm.
The code could be transformed very easily to look for a specific item in a subset, right now it looks for the item in the subset 0 to n (the whole array basically).
If the array is not sorted it will be sorted by another method before using the binary search method.
